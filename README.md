# Explainable-AI-using-Tobii-and-Muse-S
To use EEG signal as well as the eye tracking information captured while looking at a brain tumor CT scan image by using the sensors. The information gather will be helpful in explainable the Brain Tumor CT scan images. Also there is no current novel explanation technique that explains the prediction of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner specialized for medical images. We used two main sensors Muse-S and Tobi Eye tracker. The dataset we used was Brain CT scan images from Kaggle. We created a windows application program as well as a Python API to collect data from both the sensors. In the windows application program we used the Tobi SDK to get the stream of (x,y) co-ordinates and BLUE-Muse for getting the EEG signals from the Muse-S.
